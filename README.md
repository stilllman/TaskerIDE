# TaskerIDE
TaskerIDE is an IDE for writing Tasker tasks and profiles on your PC.

It will include a custom language for writing profiles and tasks in a more natural way, along with all the features
you would expect from an IDE: autocompletion, syntax highligthing, refactoring, etc. The profiles and tasks will then
be "compiled" into an XML file that can be imported into Tasker.

The IDE is built upon JetBrain's MPS platform, a language workbench that streamlines the creation of languages
(Domain Specific Languages, languages extensions, etc.), editors and generators.

This project is currently a work in progress, and is absolutely not usable at the moment.
